> An AI-powered web application for analyzing drug-food interactions using NLP and Machine Learning with automated multi-class classification and knowledge graph generation.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 🧬 Novel Contributions
1. **Automated NLP Classification** - 6 categories: Contraindicated ❌ | Avoid ⚠️ | CYP enzymes 🧪 | Alters metabolism 🔄 | Enhances absorption 📈 | Safe ✅
2. **Knowledge Graph (DFIKG)** - Structured triplets: `Drug → Interaction Type → Food/Supplement` with interactive querying and CSV export

### 🤖 ML Pipeline
- TF-IDF Vectorization with bigrams | Ensemble Models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) | Cosine Similarity Search | Auto best-model selection

### 📊 Dashboard
Real-time semantic search | Color-coded severity (🔴🟡🟢) | Dynamic visualizations | Performance metrics | Downloadable results

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Google Colab (Recommended)
```
!pip install -q streamlit pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
from google.colab import files; uploaded = files.upload()
!wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/drug-food-interaction/main/app.py
!streamlit run app.py & npx localtunnel --port 8501
```

### Local Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/drug-food-interaction.git
cd drug-food-interaction
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

## 📋 Requirements
```
streamlit>=1.28.0
pandas>=2.0.0
numpy>=1.24.0
scikit-learn>=1.3.0
matplotlib>=3.7.0
seaborn>=0.12.0
```

## 📊 Dataset Format
| Column | Type | Description | Example |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| `name` | string | Drug name | "Warfarin" |
| `reference` | string | Source | "DrugBank:DB00682" |
| `food_interactions` | string | Details | "Avoid vitamin K foods, grapefruit juice inhibits CYP3A4" |

**Sample CSV:**
```
name,reference,food_interactions
Warfarin,DrugBank:DB00682,"Avoid green leafy vegetables high in vitamin K. Grapefruit juice may inhibit CYP3A4 enzyme."
Metformin,DrugBank:DB00331,"Take with food to enhance absorption. Limit alcohol consumption."
Aspirin,DrugBank:DB00945,"Avoid alcohol - increases bleeding risk. Take with food to reduce GI irritation."
```

## 🎯 Usage

**1. Search Drugs** - Enter condition/drug → Set results count → Click Search → View similarity scores & details  
**2. Query KG** - Filter by Drug/Food/Type/Severity → Export as CSV  
**3. Visualizations** - Explore Distribution/Categories/Severity tabs  
**4. Export** - Download complete knowledge graph

## 🏗️ Architecture
```
Streamlit Frontend → NLP Classifier (6 classes) + ML Recommender (TF-IDF) → Knowledge Graph Builder → Visualization Engine
```

## 📈 Model Performance
| Model | Accuracy | F1 Score |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 0.944 | 0.943 |
| Random Forest | 0.986 | 0.986 |
| **Gradient Boosting** | **0.992** | **0.992** |

## 🔬 Implementation

### NLP Classification
```
def classify_interaction(text):
    text = text.lower()
    if "contraindicated" in text or "fatal" in text:
        return "Contraindicated"
    if "avoid" in text or "dangerous" in text:
        return "Avoid"
    if "cyp" in text or "enzyme" in text:
        return "Interacts with CYP enzymes"
    if "metabolism" in text:
        return "Alters metabolism"
    if "absorption" in text:
        return "Enhances absorption"
    return "Safe"
```

### Knowledge Graph Structure
```
Drug Node ──[interaction_type]──> Food Node
    │                                  │
    └─ name, reference, severity      └─ name, category, mechanism
```
